If you're good at spotting viral posts before they blow up:

Let others trade on your insights
Earn fees from all transactions
Train an AI to extend your curation style

#### How it Works for Curators

1. **Spot Potential**: Find a promising cast early on and create a market for it.
2. **Let Others Trade**: As the post gains traction, traders buy in
3. **Earn Curator Fees**: Get a 2% cut of all transaction volume in your market.

#### How it Works

1. **Name your based agent**: Give your agent a personality.
2. **Set up a risk tolerance**: Decide your parameters and stick to them.
3. **Automated compound investments**: Watch your agent make intelligent decisions on existing markets and grow your portfolio.
